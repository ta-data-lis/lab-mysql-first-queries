**7. Take a look on the data you retrieved in the question 5. Give some insights.** 

The top app genres are Games, Social Networking and Music which are all free.

**8. Take a look on the data you retrieved in the question 6. Give some insights.** 

The majority are game apps plus a mixed bag of useful apps for different purposes (flashlight, document scanner, etc). These are apps with a very distintive purpose of either scanning a document, or to provide light. The lack of complexity and multi tasks that these apps provide possibly influence the rating. If they allow the user to execute the one function executable by the app, there is very little reason to give a low rating. In regards to the games, I believe these are very casual games that the player does not expect much complexity from.

**9. Now compare the data from questions 5 and 6. What do you see?**

None of the most rated apps are considered the best rated apps. The total number of ratings in the best rated apps is very small.

**10. How could you take the top 3 regarding the user ratings but also the number of votes?**
TurboScan™ Pro - document & receipt scanner: scan multiple pages and photos to PDF	28388	5
:) Sudoku +	11447	5

**11. Does people care about the price?** Do some queries, comment why are you doing them and the results you retrieve. What is your conclusion?
There is a preference for free apps.
