Please, import the .csv database called *AppleStore.csv*. Use the *data* table to query the data about Apple Store Apps and answer the following questions: 

**1. Which are the different genres?**

Music
Utilities
Travel
Social Networking
Sports
Business
Health & Fitness
Entertainment
Photo & Video
Navigation
Education


**2. Which is the genre with more apps rated?**
2974676		Social Networking


**3. Which is the genre with more apps?**
Games		3808


**4. Which is the one with less?**

**5. Take the 10 apps most rated.**

5	▻Sudoku +

**7. Take a look on the data you retrieved in the question 5. Give some insights.**
The top 10 at question 5 are mostly very well known apps, that are games, social or music apps. 


**8. Take a look on the data you retrieved in the question 6. Give some insights.**
There are a few double apps in question 6, and the apps are mostly not about sharing things with others. 


**9. Now compare the data from questions 5 and 6. What do you see?**
In 6 there are no social apps and you can't interact with other users, they are mostly for the user itself. Could be that 6 are 
more apps that people find them selfs to fill needs they know they have and that 5 are apps that people download without 
actually needing them but they fill the (first) latent need to be in touch throught the digital world with others. 


**10. How could you take the top 3 regarding the user ratings but also the number of votes?**
SELECT track_name FROM applestore ORDER BY user_rating * rating_count_tot DESC LIMIT 3;
Facebook
Instagram
Clash of Clans


**11. Does people care about the price?** Do some queries, comment why are you doing them and the results you retrieve. What is your conclusion?
#first look at the highest price and the amount of downloads compaired to the top 10 with size, genre and rating included
SELECT track_name, price, size_bytes, user_rating_ver, prime_genre FROM applestore ORDER BY price DESC LIMIT 10;

What do I see?
Mostly serious apps that are the more expensive (like business & education) and they are gigantic in size, barely any user ratings. 


#first look at the lowest price (not free) and the amount of downloads compaired to the top 10 with size, genre and rating included
SELECT track_name, price, size_bytes, user_rating_ver, prime_genre FROM applestore WHERE price !=0 ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 10;

What do I see?
Mostly fun apps, the minimum price is 0.99 dollar, ratings differ. 

#Look if and which there is a payed app in the top10 then look at the rating for this
SELECT track_name, price, size_bytes, user_rating_ver, prime_genre FROM applestore ORDER BY user_rating DESC LIMIT 10;

What do I see?
Out of the top10 with highest user satifastion 9 apps are payed, so if people like apps they are willing to pay. 

Conclusion:
Not enough data to create a clear awnser on this question, I would need to see how often people use the app or download the apps.
Hypothesis that I would test on bigger dataframe: 
- People are willing to pay for apps with a higher user satisfation. 
- People are willing to pay more for apps 'serious' apps then for fun apps. 
- People are willing to pay more for apps that are bigger in sizes then apps that are smaller in size. 


## Deliverables 
You need to submit a `.sql` file that includes the queries used to answer the questions above, as well as an `.md` file including your answers.
