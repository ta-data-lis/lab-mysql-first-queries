**7. Take a look on the data you retrieved in the question 5. Give some insights.**
The top 10 at question 5 are mostly very well known apps, that are games, social or music apps. 

**8. Take a look on the data you retrieved in the question 6. Give some insights.**
There are a few double apps in question 6, and the apps are mostly not about sharing things with others. 

**9. Now compare the data from questions 5 and 6. What do you see?**
In 6 there are no social apps and you can't interact with other users, they are mostly for the user itself. Could be that 6 are 
more apps that people find them selfs to fill needs they know they have and that 5 are apps that people download without 
actually needing them but they fill the (first) latent need to be in touch throught the digital world with others. 

**10. How could you take the top 3 regarding the user ratings but also the number of votes?**

**11. Does people care about the price?** Do some queries, comment why are you doing them and the results you retrieve. What is your conclusion?
