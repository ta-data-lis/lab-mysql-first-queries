# Lab | My first queries

Please, import the .csv database called *AppleStore.csv*. Use the *data* table to query the data about Apple Store Apps and answer the following questions: 

**1. Which are the different genres?**

**2. Which is the genre with more apps rated?**

**3. Which is the genre with more apps?**

**4. Which is the one with less?**

**5. Take the 10 apps most rated.**

**6. Take the 10 apps best rated by users.**

**7. Take a look on the data you retrieved in the question 5. Give some insights.**

The 2 apps most rated are facebook and instagram - both are social network apps that have many users.

**8. Take a look on the data you retrieved in the question 6. Give some insights.**
The 10 apps best rated are mainly games apps. 

**9. Now compare the data from questions 5 and 6. What do you see?**
A bigger number of rates of a certain app doesn't mean that app has a better rating. 

**10. How could you take the top 3 regarding the user ratings but also the number of votes?**

**11. Does people care about the price?** Do some queries, comment why are you doing them and the results you retrieve. What is your conclusion?
We can see by the queries that the best rated apps have a mean price above or similar to the ones with lower rating. So by this we can say 
that the people doesn't seem to care abou the price.

## Deliverables 
You need to submit a `.sql` file that includes the queries used to answer the questions above, as well as an `.md` file including your answers.
