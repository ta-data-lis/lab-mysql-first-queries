**7. Take a look on the data you retrieved in the question 5. Give some insights.**
FROM the too 10 apps most rated, the social networking apps are the most rated, also because they are probably used more often by the users. We can also analyse that the other apps that are most rated are music and gaming apps, which users also use frequently.  

**8. Take a look on the data you retrieved in the question 6. Give some insights.**
According to this data, we can see that users tends to rank productivity apps with higher classifications because they work well and serve the purpose of the user. 

**9. Now compare the data from questions 5 and 6. What do you see?**
I can observe that the apps that are more rated are not the ones that have the higher ranks in user's ratings. 

**10. How could you take the top 3 regarding the user ratings but also the number of votes?**
21292	4
161065	4
188583	3.5

**11. Does people care about the price?** Do some queries, comment why are you doing them and the results you retrieve. What is your conclusion?
Yes. The most rated apps are free to the users and the most expensive apps are only paid and used by a few users as seen in the queries.
