First i did a query to find out the average rating for paid apps and free apps, and the rating for the paid apps ie higher. 

The average price of paid apps is 3,88 , the average user rating of apps with a price above the mean is 3.79 and with the price below is 3.48. 

So paid apps are rated higher than free apps, and more expensive apps are rated higher than less expensive.
