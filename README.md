# Lab | My first queries

Please, import the .csv database called *AppleStore.csv*. Use the *data* table to query the data about Apple Store Apps and answer the following questions:

**1. Which are the different genres?**
**Games, Productivity, Weather, Shopping, Reference, Finance, Music, Utilities, Travel, Social Networking, Sports, Business, Health & Fitness, Entertainment, Photo & Video, Navigation, Education, Lifestyle, Food & Drinks, News, Book, Medical, Catalogs**

**2. Which is the genre with more apps rated?**
**Games**

**3. Which is the genre with more apps?**
**Games**

**4. Which is the one with less?**
**Catalogs**

**5. Take the 10 apps most rated.**
**Facebook, Instagram, Clahs of Clans, Temple Run, Pandora - Music & Radio, Pinterest, Bible, Candy Crush Saga, Spotify Music, Angry Birds**

**6. Take the 10 apps best rated by users.**
**:) Sudoku +,King of Dragon Pass, TurboScan, Plats vs Zombies, Learn to Speak Spanish, Plants vs Zombies HD, The Photographer's Ephemeris, Sudoku +, Flashlight, Infinity Blade**

**7. Take a look on the data you retrieved in the question 5. Give some insights.**
**These results make sense, all of the APPs make perfect sense to be in top 10 most rated because they are also (probably, considering their popularity) in the Top 10 in terms of number of downloads**

**8. Take a look on the data you retrieved in the question 6. Give some insights.**
**On the hand, although not surprising, the 10 best rated APPS are some random ones (due to few, but good reviews)**

**9. Now compare the data from questions 5 and 6. What do you see?**
**The APPs in question 5 and 6 are totally different. This happens because least rated APPs can have perfect scores due to few revies. On the other hand, APPs with millions of reviews will never be able to get perfect scores, and thus don't appear in the Top 10. A more correct analysis would be to compare bot number of ratings as weel as the rating itself.**

**10. How could you take the top 3 regarding the user ratings but also the number of votes?**
**Head Soccer, Plants vs Zombies, Snipes 3D Assassin**

**11. Does people care about the price?** Do some queries, comment why are you doing them and the results you retrieve. What is your conclusion?
**The higher priced apps have few downloads and the most downloaded APPS are free or have low prices. Thus, people do care about prices.**
