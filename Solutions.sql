/* 8th Question */
/* The increment of the rating is only 0.5, which means there will be a lot of ratings with 5. How to choose which one of those are the important 10 to display? Best is to take an */
/* additional parameter into consideration that lets us decide about the improtance of the ratings i.e. the rating count. Taking into consideration both rating value and count, we can */
/* decide that the most important ratings with 5 are those who also have the highest rating count. */

/* Amongst the top 20 ratings is no price over â‚¬10. The most expensive are not best rated. It means that for a lower price the satisfaction seems to grow because the cost/benefit relationship */
/* is better. When people pay a high price, they have higher expectation and hence it is easier to disappoint i.e. result in lower rating. */
