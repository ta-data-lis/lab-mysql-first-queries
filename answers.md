Insights on Applestore.csv Analysis

7.Considering that we are analysing a dataset about the apps on the AppStore, I was expecting that the most rated apps would
be the most used,i.e, Facebook and Instagram would be the apps with more reviews in the AppleStore, and in fact, that occurs. 
Facebook, Instagram and Pinterest are Social Networking apps and, predictably, they are on the top most rated.  
There are 4 games and 2 music streaming apps on the top most_rated. Surprisingly for me, the remaining App on the top most rated
is an app that contains the digital Bible. Considering that there are an estimated 1.2 billion catholics in the world, I can see
the reason behind this amazing number for the App Bible.

8. The 3 best rated apps are Head Soccer, Plants vs. Zombies and Sniper 3D Assassin. All the best rated apps in top 10 are Games, 
except one - Domino's Pizza USA. It actually makes sense, because, one of the most common foods for gamers is pizza.
Seems like Domino's is making and delivering great pizzas for late night cravings in America!

9.None of the top 10 most rated apps are on the top 10 best rated apps. The most used are also the most exposed.

10.I've done that since the beggining of my analysis. Because, in my opinion, it is not accurate to compare a 5 star app
with 10 reviews against a 5 star app with 50000 reviews.

11.Comparing apps that are free with apps that cost 0.99 cents, we can see that there less 75 million reviews on the second one.
The difference between apps that are 4.99 and free is about 79 million. So, the biggest barrier starts at the moment you have to
pay any value to get the App. I divided the prices by ranges, and I got the following results:

For price=0 the number of reviews is about 79.973.561
For price between 0.98 and 20 there are about 12.556.082
For price  between 20 and 100 there are about 10795
For price>100 the number of reviews is 814

There is a huge difference between free apps and cheap apps. And the difference only gets bigger, as we move up in the price range.
Based on my analysis, I consider that price does has a role on people's will to adquire an App.
