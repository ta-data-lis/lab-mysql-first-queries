7. Take a look on the data you retrieved in the question 5. Give some insights.

8. Take a look on the data you retrieved in the question 6. Give some insights.
In the data we can see the top 10 apps with the highest average rating from the users.
However, the rating does not consider the number of rating given by the users,
so it is possible that the highest rated apps can only have 1 user rating.
It is not the best way to see the best apps according to the users. 


9. Now compare the data from questions 5 and 6. What do you see?
We can see that the apps with the highest rating does not mean that it is the best apps, as there may not be
many people who downloaded the apps and give ratings.


11. Does people care about the price?
To know whether people care about price, we can look at the price of the apps and how many ratings left
by the users (to give an idea of how many people downloaded the apps).
From the query we can see that the amount of ratings left is increasing as the price becomes cheaper.
We can say that people are more hesitant to buy expensive apps.
