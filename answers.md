**9. Now compare the data from questions 5 and 6. What do you see?**

Games like games the most, but bother to rate other stuff as well. 

**10. How could you take the top 3 regarding the user ratings but also the number of votes?**

We could make a separate table and do an inner join?

**11. Do people care about the price?** Do some queries, comment why are you doing them and the results you retrieve. What is your conclusion?

From the Top 20 apps, only two of them are paid and they're both games. Price matters.
