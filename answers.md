**7. Take a look on the data you retrieved in the question 5. Give some insights.**

The most rated apps are popular apps, for example social networks.


**8. Take a look on the data you retrieved in the question 6. Give some insights.**

These are different from the most rated apps, mostly games, they are less controversial.

**9. Now compare the data from questions 5 and 6. What do you see?**

The most rated apps, since they are rated by a lot of people, often dont have a perfect rating. 
Apps that are rated by less people are more likely to have a rating of 5.

**11. Does people care about the price?** 

Like its expected, free apps have a lot more ratings (rating_count_tot) as they are used by more people. I cant spot any correlation between price and rating (user_rating)
