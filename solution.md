**7. Take a look on the data you retrieved in the question 5. Give some insights.**

- It makes sense that the 10 apps most rated belong to the genres with more apps rated (Social Networking) and with more apps total (Games).

**8. Take a look on the data you retrieved in the question 6. Give some insights.**

- The 10 apps best rated by users are all free (price = 0) and most of them (6/10) are in the Games genre.

**9. Now compare the data from questions 5 and 6. What do you see?**

- They are among the highest number of supported devices, are all free and belong to the highest rated genres.

**10. How could you take the top 3 regarding the user ratings but also the number of votes?**

- 'Head Soccer','Games'
- 'Plants vs. Zombies','Games'
- 'Sniper 3D Assassin: Shoot to Kill Gun Game','Games'

**11. Does people care about the price?**  
##### Do some queries -  comment why are you doing them and the results you retrieve. What is your conclusion?

- Apps with the highest prices have a lot less ratings (total), and the opposite is also true, so I think we can say that users care about price.
