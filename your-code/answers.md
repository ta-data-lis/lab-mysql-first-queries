7. Bible
8. Candy Crush Saga
9. Spotify Music
10. Angry Birds

**6. Take the 10 apps best rated by users.**

There are >10 (490) best rated apps (user_rating = 5); I filtered them further by "most rated" (rating_count_tot) as a second criterion, in order to come-up with the 10 shown below:
1. Head Soccer
2. Plants vs. Zombies
3. Sniper 3D Assassin: Shoot to Kill Gun Game
4. Geometry Dash Lite
5. Infinity Blade
6. Geometry Dash
7. Domino's Pizza USA
8. CSR Racing 2
9. Pictoword: Fun 2 Pics Guess What's the Word Trivia
10. Plants vs. Zombies HD

**7. Take a look on the data you retrieved in the question 5. Give some insights.**

Trends in the 10 most rated apps:

- _Gaming is BIG and there is some serious competition in it_: The genre of Games (most apps rated, most apps) finds 4 entries in the top 10 (5.6 M ratings or ~38% of total ratings).

  - The first two Games entries (Clash of Clans, Temple Run) contribute about double the amount of ratings (1.7-2.1 M ratings) as compared to the last two (Candy Crash Saga and Angry Birds; 0.8-1 M ratings).

- _Social dominated by Facebook_: The genre of Social Networking uptakes ~27% of the total ratings, however the first entry (Facebook, ~3 M ratings, the highest in the top 10) clearly wins over the second (Pinterest, 1.1 M ratings).

- _Instagram grows alone_: A single app in the genre of Photo & Video (Instagram, ~2.2 M ratings, the second-highest in the top 10).
  - It is noteworthy that Instagram (16%) equals both apps from Music (Pandora - Music & Radio and Spotify Music, 15%) in terms of total ratings.
  - That percentage is roughly double than the only entry in the Genre of Reference (Bible, #7 of the top 10 with ~7% of the total ratings).

**8. Take a look on the data you retrieved in the question 6. Give some insights.**

Trends in the 10 apps best rated by users (Following the assumption of question 6. with regard to the second ranking criterion: most rated apps among the apps ranked as best by users):

- _Gaming scores_: 9 out of the 10 entries are from the genre of Games (92% of the total ratings).

  - The steps of change for the total ratings in this categorization are rather gradual: from 0.48 M for the 1st (Head Soccer), to 0.43 M (#2, Plants vs. Zombies), to 0.37 M (#3, Sniper 3D Assassin: Shoot to Kill Gun Game), all the way down to 0.16 M (#10, Plants vs. Zombies HD).

  - Only one non-Games app (Domino's Pizza USA, Food & Drink, 8% of total ratings) makes it to the top 10 of users rating.

**9. Now compare the data from questions 5 and 6. What do you see?**

- None of the most rated apps has a best rated status (user_rating = 5), with 8 out of 10 having a rating of 4.5. This is inherent on the scoring audience (a high total rating count means that the max value is not easy to achieve).

- The most rated app (Facebook) has the lowest user rating (3.5) out of the most rated apps; also Pandora - Music & Radio scores low(er) than the majority (4). That could be an indication that the audience preference is moving away from these two apps.


**10. How could you take the top 3 regarding the user ratings but also the number of votes?**

I would follow a similar logic to the one applied in question 6. namely:
- Ordering the rows by user rating (user_rating) in descending order
- Ordering the rows by maximum user rating (user_rating = 5) and by total number of votes (rating_count_tot) in descending order
- Filtering the top 3 rows

That would eventually return a top 3, from question 6. top 10:
1. Head Soccer
2. Plants vs. Zombies
3. Sniper 3D Assassin: Shoot to Kill Gun Game

**11. Does people care about the price?**

Defining "care" as a metric that takes into account rating score and the total reviews people will leave.

Do people review apps when they like/dislike them equally?
- The great majority of reviews (88%) is for apps that are rated between 3.5 and 4.5
  - The minimum of the rating scale is 1
  - What is "like" and what is "dislike" in terms of rating score?

Defining "like" (highly-rated reviews, 4.5 = 63% of total reviews) and "dislike" (badly-rated reviews, 3.5 = 12% of total reviews) in the aforementioned range, and try to find if price plays a role
- 45% (1183 out of 2644) of the apps people "like" are paid
- 46% (323 out of 697) of the apps people "dislike" are paid

What is the average rating of (reviewed) paid and free apps?
The average rating of (reviewed) paid apps is 4.05, identical to the one of free apps.

Concluding: Price could matter (a bit) if we define only rating as "care". On a more broad definition of "care", that considers rating score and the total reviews people will leave, no clear conclusion on the influence of price can be made.
